## Cyberkavach Phishing Attack Domain Detection with Machine Learning

#### ðŸ”¥ Official Website ðŸ‘‰ [cyberkavach.phishing_url.app](https://phishr.vercel.app/)
Enter any URL and our Machine Learning model will scan the URL and tell you if its malicious or not.

## ðŸŽ¯ Objective
Phishing is a type of fraud in which an attacker impersonates a reputable company or person in order to get sensitive information such as login credentials or account information via email or other communication channels.Phishing is popular among attackers because it is easier to persuade someone to click a malicious link that appears to be authentic than it is to break through a computer's protection measures.


The main goal of this project is  to create a domain authentication system that would detect if a given domain url is legit or fake website created to perform fraud. Multiple ML models will be tested for this problem. A web Interface along with suitable Rest-API's will be created for non-commercialized use.

## Project Workflow
The project will follow the same approach as used in all ML project. We'll go through different stages of data collection,feature extraction,training and finally deployment of trained model.

- Data Collection
- Feature Extraction
- Model training & evaluation
- Deployment
